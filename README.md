# LearningBase

## Project Description
LearningBase is a web application designed to facilitate a learning experience, potentially incorporating gamified elements such as quests, courses, streak tracking, and experience points (XP) display. It appears to be built with modern web technologies and might integrate with Web3/blockchain functionalities.

## Features
- **Courses**: Manage and display various learning courses.
- **Quests**: Interactive quests to guide users through learning paths.
- **Streak Tracker**: Track user engagement and learning consistency.
- **XP Display**: Visualize earned experience points.
- **Dashboard**: A central hub for users to view their progress and activities.
- **Web3 Integration**: Potential integration with blockchain technologies (e.g., Hardhat for smart contract development).

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, CSS Modules (or similar for styling)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Package Manager**: npm (or yarn, based on `package-lock.json`)
- **Web3/Blockchain**: Hardhat (suggested by `hardhat.config.js`), potentially Ethers.js or Web3.js (suggested by `web3.ts`)

## Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js) or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ftimurlenk/LearningBase.git
    cd LearningBase
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or if you use yarn
# yarn dev
```

This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## Usage
(This section will be more detailed once the project's specific functionalities are clearer. For now, it's a placeholder.)
Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your web browser. Navigate through the dashboard, courses, and quests to explore the learning platform.
